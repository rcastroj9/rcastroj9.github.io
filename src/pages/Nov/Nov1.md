𝙷𝚊𝚙𝚙𝚢 𝙷𝚊𝚕𝚕𝚘𝚠𝚎𝚎𝚗! 🎃
.
Oh how I would love for it to be halloween every single day so I can wear this onesie to work every day 🤗
. 
Wanted to share with you two really nice email subscriptions that have helped me keep updated with new technologies and practicing for technical interviews daily (well they remind me daily and I do them when I can lol)
1️⃣ Subscribe to Quincy Larson emails! You will receive an email weekly on five really useful links or tips to keep you updated.
2️⃣ Check out LeetCode! This is a new platform for me, which has helped me to practice OOP questions for tech interviews. .
What do you use to keep yourself on the flow of new apps?
