Happy Sunday almost Monday 💛 ready to start the week? cause I am not 😩
.
.
I started school this past Monday and I am actually pretty exited for my classes! 🤗 (Prob will die trying but still exited). I am taking:
-> Simulation of Complex Systems
-> Calc lll
-> Linear Algebra 2.
-> International economics ❣️
and my fav
-> Computer Systems ❣️❣️
. 
Please pray for my sanity haha 🙃. Last week I also attended a Google information session 🌟 #googleoncampus in which they shared some really amazing insight on their culture and their workflow. I am sure you guys don’t need any more convincing on why you should work at Google but here it is: .
-> Google offers classes for their employees, all the way from cooking to how to manage your money. If you can’t find the class you are looking for you can take it outside and they will pay for 2/3 of the class price 😯 -> Google encourages their employees to work 80% on their job and 20% on side projects of their own🌟This is how Gmail, Google Maps and many other tools were created 😯
-> Finally the ideology of “eating your own dog food” on their workflow. This step happens before they launch to prod a new feature. First they launch the feature to all the googlers so they can try and patch any bugs and it is called the “Dogfood” process 🐶 .

Whew big post, hope you guys have an amaizing week 🎆, and stay tuned for my next post on: Resume tips ♥ ✅
