🌟 RESUME TIPS! 🌟

Happy Monday everyone 🤓 hope you guys have a great week ♥ I will start right away cause it might be a long one 📝 
All the following resume tips are from a Google Resume Critique talk I went to last week #googleoncampus 💛💙❤️💚
Enjoy! ❤️

A great pro tip is to describe you'r past job positions using bullet points, let’s start with a template for these: 
1. Start with action words 💥 
Examples: Implemented, Developed, Deployed, Accomplished, Monitored, etc.
2. Mention the technologies you used 💻.
You should have a list of the technologies/languages/tools you know on a specific side section on your resume already but, that’s not enough😏 Try to mention what specific technology you used on the job, that way reviewers will know where you learned it from.🤔
3. Finally, add some metrics to it 💯💲
Reviewers want to see the impact you made, for example: reduced 61% rate of failure or used by 200+ users.

Now let’s put it all together. 😊
Implemented 1️⃣ using 2️⃣ which 3️⃣ -> Implement data visualization feature using D3.JS and React which reached 200+ followers.

Extra tips: 
1. Keep it in PDF format. This will be easier for reviewers in case they download it.
2. Keep it clean and concise. 
3. Keep it to 1 or 2 pages MAX. 
4. If you are a student, keep your education section on the top and 👉🏼add your graduation date and month👈🏼(❗️IMPORTANT❗️).
5. Add any courses you have taken online or in school and specifically what language/tool you learned from it. Also add anything you are currently learning!
6. Taylor each resume to the job’s description. 
7. Bold anything you think is important for them to see, for example I bold all the languages/tools they are specifically asking for so it is easier for them to see it or any huge accomplishment like “reduced rate failure by 61%”.

Hope you found them useful ♥ I will be making the same post in Spanish WED. If you know anyone that would need it, please share it. 💙 
Have to go back to apply for summer internships. ☀️

</HappyCoding💕>
