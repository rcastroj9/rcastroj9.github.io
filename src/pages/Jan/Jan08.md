🥂 HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE! 🥂
<br />
<br /> Check out my beautiful necklace! YES it is Ecuador 🇪🇨 I am such in love with it 😍 wanted to take a little piece of it with me. So following the tradition I want to also share my new year’s resolutions ✅ This year I made reasonable resolutions and a little bit more focused on my mental health and self care. Here we go ❤
.
<br /> 👉🏻 Read at least 10 pgs everyday before going to sleep.
<br /> 👉🏻 Exercise at least 3 times a week. (Hopefully find a sport I love and will do it more often)
<br /> 👉🏻 LeetCode / CodeWar at least twice a week
<br /> 👉🏻 Stop using the snooze button (huge problem of mine 😓 #ilovesleeping)
<br /> 👉🏻 Post on IG twice a week!
<br />.
<br />Yep you read that last one right 😊 So expect to see more pics of my beautiful face or my computer 💻 hahah. Most of all my posts will of course be tech focused 
<br /> -> (Next one is on going back to school and what I learned a GOOGLE info session I attended ✏️)
<br />.
<br />Love you guys, thanks for all the messages during the holidays ❤
<br />.
<br />Which one do you think is your hardest to accomplish NY resolution?
.
<br /></Happy Coding💕>
